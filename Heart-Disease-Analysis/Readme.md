# 🫀 Heart Disease Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a dataset related to heart disease and uncover patterns or risk factors associated with the disease. The goal is to extract actionable insights and provide data-driven recommendations for health management and prevention.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset (`heart_disease.csv`) contains medical and lifestyle information about individuals. Key features include:
- Age, BMI, Sleep Hours
- Blood Pressure
- Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS)
- CRP, Homocysteine
- Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Sugar Intake
- Family history, Diabetes
- Heart Disease status (target)

---

## 🎯 Key Questions Addressed
1. What are the demographic characteristics of people with heart disease?
2. Is there a gender-based difference in prevalence?
3. Is high blood pressure or cholesterol associated with heart disease?
4. Are physically active individuals less likely to be affected?
5. How do sleep, sugar, and alcohol consumption relate to heart health?
6. Which biological markers (CRP, FBS, Homocysteine) are most correlated with heart disease?
7. Does family history or diabetes increase risk?
8. What are the most recurring risk factors among patients?

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Analysis Steps
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Visualization of Key Risk Factors**
4. **Comparative Plots between Diseased & Non-Diseased**
5. **Correlation Checks for Biological Markers**
6. **Answering Analytical Questions**
7. **Generating Recommendations**

## 📈 Main Findings
- Older individuals with higher BMI and less sleep are more prone to heart disease.
- Males show slightly higher risk levels.
- Blood pressure and cholesterol are strongly associated with the disease.
- Inactive lifestyle, high sugar, and alcohol intake elevate the risk.
- Biological markers like CRP, FBS, and Homocysteine are significantly higher among patients.
- Family history and diabetes notably increase the chances of developing the disease.

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Promote public health awareness around sleep, diet, and exercise.
- Encourage regular screenings for at-risk biomarkers.
- Focus health efforts on high-risk populations.
- Implement behavioral support to reduce harmful habits (smoking, alcohol).
